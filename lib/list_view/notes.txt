ListView:

Whenever we have list of items wants to show then we can use ListView. it comes with scroll behaviour
in both direction (horizontal and vertical by providing direction to scrollDirection param of ListView ).
Also we can change the behaviour of scrolling by providing value to physics param.

If your list items is in repeated then we should use ListView.builder instead ListView and if you want
a separation between each list item then you should use ListView.separated.


Example:

ListView(
    children:[
        item1,
        item2,
        item3,
        ....
       ]
    )

ListView.builder(
    builder:(BuildContext context, int index){
          return Item();
        },
    itemCount: 2 // how many items that you want to need to be build
    )


ListView.separated(
    builder:(BuildContext context, int index){
          return Item();
        },
    separateBuilder:(BuildContext context, int index){
            return SizedBox(height:20); // will create gap between every item by height 20
        }
    itemCount: 2 // how many items that you want to need to be build
    )
