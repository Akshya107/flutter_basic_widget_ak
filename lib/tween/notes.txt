Tween:

when we talk about Animation so we have one point from where we start our animation and end at some point.
so to calculate the each vale in between starting state to end state we use a "Tween"
"Tween" helps to define all the values in between an animation's start and end values.

EXAMPLE:
Create an animation that shows text size increases from 16 to 32.
