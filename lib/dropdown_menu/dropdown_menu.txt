DropDownMenu:

When our requirements is like we need to select an option from list of option so in small list case

we can use radio and segmented button but what if we have large list so then Dropdown comes into picture.

Example:

DropDownMenu(
    dropdownMenuEntries: <DropdownMenuEntry<String>>[
      DropdownMenuEntry(value:"One", label:'One'),
      DropdownMenuEntry(value:"two", label:'Two'),
      DropdownMenuEntry(value:"three", label:'Three'),
    ]
)
