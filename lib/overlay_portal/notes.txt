OverlayPortal:

Generally child widget is positioned to it's parent but sometime we want logically related to it's
parents but visually separate like tool-tip or floating menu. so in that case we use Overlay Portal.

OverlayPortal is a widget that allow us to paint a widget anywhere on the screen on top of a widgets.
Add an overlay by passing OverlayPortal widget as child to the widgets that's associated with it's like Icon, Button.

Example:


ElevatedButton(   //this is our widget on which we want an OverlayPortal that's why we passing OverlayPortal as child to this button
    child: OverlayPortal(
        controller : overlayController // provide a controller to toggle this overlay
        overlayChildBuilder: (BuildContext context){
                     return Text("This is an overlay");
            }
        )
    )
