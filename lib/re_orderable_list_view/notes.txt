ReOrderableListView:

As we all used ListView but what if our requirements is to re-order the list view by dragging and
dropping then ReOrderableListView comes into picture.


Example:

ReorderableListView(
    onReorder: (oldIndex, newIndex){
            setState((){
            updateListItems(oldIndex, newIndex);
            });
        },
    children:[
        list of items, must have unique key
    ]
   )
